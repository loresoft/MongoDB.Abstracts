/// <typeparam name="TDiscriminator">The type used to discriminate between different MongoDB database connections.</typeparam>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This class enables type-safe dependency injection scenarios where multiple MongoDB database connections
/// need to be distinguished and resolved independently. The discriminator type acts as a compile-time
/// identifier that allows dependency injection containers to register and resolve multiple database
/// connections without ambiguity.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Common discriminator patterns include enums, marker interfaces, or simple struct types that represent
/// different database contexts such as tenant-specific databases, read/write replicas, or separate
/// application domains. This approach eliminates the need for string-based service keys or complex
/// factory patterns while maintaining type safety.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The discriminator pattern is particularly useful in multi-tenant applications, microservices
/// architectures, or scenarios where the same entity types exist across multiple MongoDB databases
/// but require separate connection management.
/// </para>
