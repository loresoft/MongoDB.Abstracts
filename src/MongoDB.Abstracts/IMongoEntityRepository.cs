/// </para>
/// <para>

/// multiple instances of the same entity repository interface for different database contexts.
/// Common discriminator patterns include enums, marker interfaces, or simple struct types that
/// represent different connection contexts.

/// This pattern enables type-safe dependency injection while maintaining clean separation between
/// different data contexts without requiring complex factory patterns or service locators.
